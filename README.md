My ToDo List

I have a lot of todo lists, mainly in trello boards and the like.

Many just grow until they get too big.

Would be nice to have some sort of decay function.... and accompanying alert
when they're about to disappear completely or dissolve.
I don't know, maybe at that time archive and remind in 2 weeks/months.

each item can be categorised along many dimensions. yee ha!

explore much tech with this!
